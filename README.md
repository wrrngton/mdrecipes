# mdrecipes

mdrecipes is like [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), but for recipes, written in Python.

It isn't a fork of mdbook, but it's own program that takes its general design from mdbook, but with additional features:

- Less wiki-ey, more like your own personal recipe book
- Support for recipe categories and tags
- Ability to create recipes from the URLs of online recipes and automatically categorise them
